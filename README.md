# Genetic_Alg_And_2048
A modular genetic algorithm setup and a recreation of the game "2048" for the algorithm to learn to beat.
Files named #rounds were trained with each generation getting n rounds of "2048" before selection based on average score. "Networks by rounds of testing per gen.png" is a graph of the training progress of networks with various rounds per gen.
